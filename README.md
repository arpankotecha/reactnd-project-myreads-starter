This application helps manage the reading list. It categorizes books into 3 separate shelves - 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Read'. Easily move books between shelves. You can easily add new books by clicking on add new books button and searching for new books. Once a book has been found, just move it to the desired shelf. Easily remove books from your library if you don't want to track it anymore.

Happy reading.

## Install
git clone https://github.com/arpankotecha/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
npm start

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
